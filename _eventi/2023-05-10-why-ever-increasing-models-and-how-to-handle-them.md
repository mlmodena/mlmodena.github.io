Deep learning is rapidly and radically transforming the way science and industry use data to solve problems. Deep neural network models have proven to be powerful tools for extracting information from data in a large number of domains. As these models grow in complexity to solve increasingly challenging problems with larger and larger datasets, the need for scalable methods and software to train them grows too.

This presentation aims to provide participants with a practical understanding of deep learning on large systems, including fundamental concepts, optimization opportunities, and scalability techniques.
