3D data enables many use cases across all types of industries and when complemented with regular 2D imaging, the potential increases even further.
What are the main current technologies for producing 3D data? Which pros and cons? And the costs? Are these sustainable at the edge? 

Deep Vision will take you on a broad-spectrum journey through 3D reconstruction technologies and then delve into one of the most relevant ones, namely stereo vision: this approach has been known and used in computer vision for more than 40 years, and is currently being challenged and yet strengthened by deep learning.
