MLOps is a discipline focused on the deployment, testing, monitoring, and automation of ML systems in production. Machine Learning Engineering professionals use tools for continuous improvement and evaluation of deployed models. They work with (or can be) Data Scientists, who develop models, to enable velocity and rigor in deploying the best performing models.

We'll talk about:

- MLOps Architectures

- Containers and Kubernetes

- KubeFlow Pipelines - KFP

- TensorFlow Extended - TFX

- MLOps on Vertex AI
