Monitor and manage plantations detecting and monitoring physical characteristics by measuring reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft) can improve production processes reducing costs whilst enhancing quality and environmental sustainability. But which information about a plantation is possible to infer from their visible spectrum images? 

**Paolo Bertellini**: Junior data scientist intern 

I am a student of Artificial intelligence engineering at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and I’m doing my curricular internship in “Abacos Group” Europe's leading player in software solutions for land resource management and control with a primary focus on precision agriculture and environmental sustainability.
